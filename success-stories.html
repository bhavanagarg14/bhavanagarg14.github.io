          <p class="my-3">I am grateful for the guidance and care I got from Bhavana. Bhavana's knowledge in nutrition is evident in every communication.  I had the problem of depression and anxiety for a long time. I could not sleep without sleeping pills, deep sleep was like a dream for me. When I talked to her she listened seriously, showed genuine compassion and understanding towards my concerns and goals. She has a deep passion for nutrition and genuinely cares about helping her clients succeed. I not only lost 20 kg but also now my depression is totally under control. Now I sleep like a baby.   If you're looking for a dedicated nutritionist, I cannot recommend Bhavana enough. Thank you so much, Bhavana.

          <p class="my-3">Taking the diet plans from Bhavana has been a transformative experience. I joined Bhavana Garg Nutrition for weight loss. However, Bhavana has guided me far beyond my weight goals. Over the past six months, I've seen significant improvements in my energy levels,  skin issues, stress management, sleep quality and, most importantly, my relationship with food. Bhavana has also helped me to develop an internal locus of control. I never imagined such a high quality of life was possible. Bhavana has been absolutely amazing in empowering me to make informed decisions and lifestyle changes that I enjoy, rather than just providing a generic diet plan with short term goals. I am really grateful to Bhavana.</p>

          <p class="my-3">My husband and I are so happy we found Bhavana. Our 9 year old daughter is a really picky eater. My daughter had severe hair loss and headaches and was always tired. She was very underweight. I was so scared about nutrient deficiency but Bhavana really took the time to listen and  answered all my questions and concerns. Thanks to her professional recommendations and nutrition diet plan. I implemented them and saw immediate results. Our daughter's eating habits have greatly improved. Now she is very energetic and her weight has also increased and now she is at normal weight. Her hair has also stopped completely. If you're looking for a dietitian to help you establish good eating habits and diet plans for your kids, Bhavana is your answer.</p>

          <p class="my-3">I had contacted Bhavana for weight loss but when I talked to her for the first time, I told her that I have been trying to conceive for many years and have taken treatment from many good doctors. She assured me that I would be able to conceive naturally. Although at that time I did not believe her words, I started the diet, I lost 13 kg during this and something happened which was no less than a miracle for my whole family: I conceived. I cannot tell you, that time Bhavana seemed no less than an angel to me, now I am the mother of a handsome boy whose credit goes only to Bhavana. I advise all those girls to contact Bhavana who has tried everything to become a mother, trust me you will not regret it.</p>

          <p class="my-3">I am a middle-class housewife. I had joint pain, acidity, headaches, and irregular periods. I was feeling tired all the time and my weight was increasing. I heard about Bhavana Garg Nutrition from my neighbor. I was afraid to join her just because I thought it would be a fancy diet with lots of expensive foods. I am surprised Bhavana provided me with a very simple diet with roti-sabji and daal-chawal, etc. She was so understanding and patient. She explained everything to me in a way that I could easily understand. She created a personalized diet plan that was easy to follow and affordable. I started feeling better within a few weeks. My joint pain reduced, my acidity and headaches disappeared, and my periods became regular. And the best part? I lost 13 kg! I feel so much more energetic and confident now. I'm so grateful to Bhavana for transforming my life in a very simple way.</p>

          <p class="my-3">I joined Bhavana Garg Nutrition for help to gain weight and I gained 16 kg. I used to eat meals but could not gain weight. Bhavana listened to my concerns and understood my problem. She made me feel at comfort and I felt that she was interested in my concerns and could help me. She made meal plans for me to help build balanced meals and healthy snacks. Even she wrote out instructions and suggestions and DOs and DONTs so that I wouldn't make any mistakes. I was especially pleased when she gave me recipes to get me started on my path to healthy eating. I also enjoyed my scheduled calls with her. We talked and had a few laughs. Bhavana knows about nutrition and understands people. I would highly recommend Bhavana Garg Nutrition to anyone needing help in planning and eating nutritional meals.</p>

          <p class="my-3">Bhavana is by far the best nutritionist around. She really knows her stuff and truly cares about her clients well being. I am someone who has suffered from acne since teenage and tried everything to get rid of it. I cannot believe how much I learned from Bhavana. I didn't know that gut health has a direct connection to your skin. Within a few weeks of starting the diet, my skin started getting clean and my skin started glowing so much that people often ask me what I apply on my face. And the best thing is that my hair has become quite thick and has stopped falling out, which is a bonus for me. She has instilled a new passion of mine which is healthy grocery shopping and cooking. Completely worth it. Highly recommend it.

          <p class="my-3">I had my yearly checkup a few months ago and found out my blood sugar was very high. Bhavana created an amazing diet plan for me. The purpose is to help me manage carbohydrate intake and lower my blood sugar. I've lost 14 kg since I started. I guess it's a great side effect of eating healthy. I feel fantastic and no longer have the afternoon energy fall. Bhavana is simply amazing and extremely knowledgeable. She takes the time and explains everything. I am very impressed that she is always passionate to help others.

          <p class="my-3">Bhavana is truly knowledgeable and knows what she is doing. We have a very very picky boy who was underweight. My son became very tired after playing a little, and was not very active like normal children, and being a mother, it pained me a lot to see my son so weak. After 1 consultation, Bhavana has helped us learn to put in place a better eating schedule. In as little as 2 weeks, after putting her plan into place, he has already been eating way more than before. We noticed a change in our son's eating habits. With her help, our son's weight has increased and he is eating a much better choice of foods. 
            Bhavana is very attentive and answers any questions you have very quickly. I am looking forward to continuing working with her. I highly recommend her to anyone struggling with a kid's bad eating habits and underweight.

          <p class="my-3"> I thought I would need to go on a restricted diet. I thought I already knew what I needed to do. I was wrong. What I needed was evidence based nutrition advice that suited me, and my circumstances. This is what I got from Bhavana. I was on the borderline of diabetes, now my blood sugar is normal. I am thrilled with her evidence-based advice, coupled with the encouragement that has put me on the right path to a nutrient dense future and a new love of cooking.

I appreciate the time she took to consider my overall health and well-being when she created my customized diet plan. Bhavana's careful analysis of my wellness and diet resulted in a plan that I have truly enjoyed following. It has transformed how I feel physically and mentally. I have lost 22 kg. Following her recommendations, I suffer from fewer back pain, migraine headaches. I feel more consistent energy, and exercise more creativity in the kitchen. She also helped my husband with his cholesterol and blood sugar. My husband and I have both benefited much from Bhavana's expertise, and can't thank her enough.

          <p class="my-3">I was diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes this past February 2024. I'm a 58 female with a family history of diabetes. I was very scared when I received my diagnosis as I didn't want to go on medication. Thankfully I found Bhavana.  Bhavana is a kind, compassionate person who has listened to all my needs but most importantly she has educated me with a lot of great nutrition ideas. Bhavana's important words that I will always remember is "don't let anyone tell you what you should or shouldn't be putting in your mouth, only you know what is best for you". 
            I have lost 13 kg so far and my energy has increased. I no longer feel any weakness. My blood sugar has also reduced a lot. Last week I went to my doctor for a routine checkup. She was very surprised and happy to see me. My diabetes medications have also been off by my doctor now. With the education of learning how to eat healthy Bhavana has made this health journey of mine much easier to manage. Thank you Bhavana so much for the great care you have given me thus far.

We had many scheduled calls and she was always on time and answered all my questions on how to change my diet and create a diet plan with meal suggestions. I had some issues besides the weight like gas, acidity and UTI. I lost not only around 45 pounds but also recovered from my health issues.

Bhavana is open as well as honest and very easy to talk to. She is very knowledgeable. She genuinely cares how you're doing. While she insists it's me that has done all the hard work, it's not something I could have done without her guidance. People around me started noticing the changes in my body before I did. But the biggest changes I have noticed are more energy, better sleep, better mood, better fitting clothes, and more confidence. Thank you Bhavana I could not have done it without you.

          <p class="my-3">I have been underweight since my childhood and I tried everything to gain weight but in the end I lost hope. When I talked to Bhavana for the first time she told me that you should consider this 3 months program as your last effort and give 100% from your side and leave the rest to me and at that very time I felt that I should do this and now I am proud of myself that I made the right decision. Working with Bhavana was absolutely worth it, she took the time to go through all my health concerns and tackle them with a very simple approach. An amazing nutritionist all around, she took the time to really explain things and inform me about my health and how I can achieve all my health goals. I gained 11kg which was unexpected for me. My periods became regular and my hair fall stopped completely. Now I feel good and look good as well and get lots of comments from others. It's a really nice feeling. Thanks Bhavana! </p>

          <p class="my-3">Before meeting Bhavana, I wasted Rs.40000/- down the drain by using the so-called nutritionist at the gym that I go to, what a big mistake I made. Trainers at gyms are great at what they do, but that is physical strength only, Bhavana professional career, educated me greatly with a wealth of knowledge of nutrition science. I lost weight with incredible energy and quality sleep. I am so happy that I was able to find Bhavana and begin my new Life of Nutrition with her along my side.</p>

Not only did she help me correct my eating habits, she also helped to see that having a positive mindset also helps a person feel good physically and mentally. With only a few changes to my lifestyle and eating habits I saw huge improvements. I lost 9 kg in just 2 months..my thyroid problems have reduced significantly.

I was also dealing with postpartum depression. I wanted to lose weight but I was afraid that a low calorie diet would make me weak. And it was becoming very difficult for me to pay full attention to myself along with a newborn child while breastfeeding. I contacted Bhavana, she listened to me very carefully and assured me that I would be able to lose weight. Within a few weeks of starting the diet plan, my clothes started getting loose, my depression started disappearing and the best thing was that my energy started increasing instead of decreasing, my mood started remaining good and I lost 23 kg in 4 months. Working with Bhavana was really wonderful. She is very knowledgeable and explained everything in ways so that I could understand. I have learned so much about nutrition from her on our scheduled calls in the past few months. I highly recommend her to anyone!

As someone who has struggled with mental health problems for years, finding Bhavana has been nothing short of a life-changing experience.  From our very first conversation her genuine passion for helping others was unique. It's not every day that you come across someone who is not only incredibly knowledgeable in their field but also possesses a heart of gold. She talked to me in each scheduled call with kindness, empathy, and a genuine desire to help me to live my healthiest, happiest life.  By following her customized diet plan, I lost 17 kg. I have now come off my medications for high blood pressure. I no longer have headaches and have increased my energy level as well.  If you are ready to begin your journey to better health and well-being, I highly recommend reaching out to Bhavana. Thank you, Bhavana, for being the guiding light on my path to wellness.

She was the only one who took the time to listen to me, understand my situation, and worked to find a solution for all my health problems. I had previously seen many dieticians, but the level of care that I received from Bhavana was top-level. She was focused on finding the root causes for my issues, identifying it, and providing me with a solution that addressed the root cause and not just the symptoms.  I felt a huge improvement in my tiredness, body pain and weakness within a few weeks of following her diet. I didn't join for weight loss  but I lost 9 kg which was I guess of a healthy balanced diet. Now I am energetic and always in a good mood. Bhavana has a professional, caring attitude towards her clients and ensures her clients' well-being. I would highly recommend her.

          <p class="my-3">Bhavana is a talented nutritionist, who listened carefully and made a nutrition diet plan for me that worked, enabled me to lose weight, and made me feel like I had so much more energy. Last time my blood sugar was very high in my blood report and on the doctor's suggestion I contacted Bhavana. I really wanted to break my sugar addiction. I joined her 28-day Sugar-Clean Program. It was amazing. I was never hungry and I lost more than 5kg in the process. And my blood sugar went down from 127 to 88 in just 28 days. She is incredibly knowledgeable, and she has a calming personality. She is also driven by science and really understands how to separate facts from myths.She cleared up many of my myths about nutrition and health by telling me the facts. Don't hesitate to work with Bhavana. She is the real deal.

          <p class="my-3">Bhavana is such an amazing resource for all my nutrition questions.  I like her non judgmental approach to eating habits, weight loss and metabolism. She has been a great dietician to talk to throughout my pregnancy and postpartum journey as well. She understands this well. Bhavana's diet plans made my entire pregnancy very comfortable. Bhavana is so wonderful to work with. I was drawn to her program as I had worked with other dietitians in the past but those programs had always been generalized. Bhavana treats every client as an individual and is always thinking outside of the box to come up with new ideas to help you reach your health goals. She is also so enthusiastic and you can really tell she truly loves what she does. I've learned so much, have so much more energy, and am so much more conscious and mindful of what I'm eating because of Bhavana's guidance. I highly recommend her as a dietitian.

She was incredibly responsive and felt more like a food therapist than a Nutritionist, which is exactly what I needed.  I had huge joint pain and I tried everything. Within a few weeks of following the diet plan, my joint pain reduced and now only It happens only when climate changes. Now my blood sugar is under control. With my Bhavana's support, I came to understand that my food choices are a direct result of my health issues like insomnia, joint pain, high cholesterol, high blood sugar. I lost 13 kg weight which is a dream come true. I learned so much it is difficult to capture it all shortly. It was all so helpful.”

Not only have my issues (bloating, gas, acidity) have resolved, I lost 11kg and learned how to eat properly in a way that didn't feel at all restrictive.

          <p class="my-3">I originally talked to Bhavana with a desire to gain control of a binging problem. I have always been an all or none eater. A “good day” consisted of only healthy eating. No sugar, no treats, and very few carbs. If I “broke down” and had one chocolate it then became a “bad day” and the eating was out of control and my whole day was bad.  As a result I tried every diet and fad to lose weight. But the only thing I gained was even worse eating habits and more binging. Food consumed my mind and I found it hard to enjoy mealtimes. She taught me how to not “diet” but eat the right amounts of a variety of food to feel full and satisfied. And most importantly she taught me that sometimes excess eating is OK. It's okay to have a treat without guilt. I now have my binging under control and eat the right amounts of food to give me the energy I need. And I have a “treat” every day – in control – knowing that there's always tomorrow to have it again. 
            And for the first time in my life I am not totally consumed with what I'm eating. I also feel confident I am teaching my friends a healthy balance about food and eating. Thanks!

With Bhavana's support, I've not only seen significant improvements in my health (cured thyroid, no joint pain now), along with losing weight but also gained a deeper understanding of nutrition. I highly recommend Bhavana to anyone seeking lasting changes while sustaining a healthy relationship with food.</p>

I felt like I was losing control of my health. My daughter convinced me to join Bhavana's diet plan. Bhavana is very knowledgeable and kind too. Her diet plans are easy to follow. She explained everything to me in a way that I could easily understand. I started feeling better within a few weeks. My arthritis pain reduced, my energy levels increased, my blood pressure stabilized, and my mood improved. I lost 8 kg! I feel so much more energetic and confident now. God bless Bhavana.

          <p class="my-3">7 years—that's how long it's been since I decided to get into the best shape possible. I trained heavily—with a trainer—doing HIIT (high-intensity interval training) and a heavy weights program at least 4 times a week. I looked ok, felt ok, but was extremely frustrated that I wasn't getting the results I wanted given the amount of effort I was putting in. Different gym trainers over the years (I've had about 5 of them) gave me nutritional advice and none of it made much difference. I just resigned myself to it being genetics and, well, "that's life". Now at 39 I decided one afternoon on a whim to search for a nutritionist. I heard about Bhavana from one of my colleagues about the work she does, and thought I'd give it a shot. The first scheduled call was right to the point. She listened to what my goals were and after a pause said, "let me guess, you want to look like this..." and sent me before and after pictures of some of her male clients. I said, "if you can get me to look like that I will have every person from my office and friends-family, neighbours I know at your door." She delivered. I started with Bhavana Garg Nutrition about 6 months ago, and here's what's happened: 

            Total body fat has gone from 20% to 10%,  Belly fat, from 24% to 9%,  Visceral fat—the deep internal fat around organs—7.5 to 3, Muscle mass, from 155 to 186, Muscle quality, from 59 to 89.,  Weight, from 92 kg to 87 kg. 
            
            And at each of my weekly check-ins the numbers just keep improving. I'm beyond thrilled with the results—looking and feeling better and better. So I've kept up my end of the bargain—telling everyone who will listen about this fantastic person and her weight loss program. I recommend Bhavana to every person who has a long-standing dream of bodybuilding.

          <p class="my-3">Bhavana has truly changed my life in the best way possible. Since I was 18 I was told the solution for my irregular period was birth control. 9 years later, at 27, I was diagnosed with PCOS and thyroid issues. I wanted to treat the root causes of my hormonal imbalance by eating the right foods as well as lose weight. Bhavana supported me and guided me brilliantly each step of the way. She is the most supportive dietician I have ever worked with. During this journey, I have lost 19 kg and my periods are regular for the first time in my life. I would recommend anyone to see Bhavana. From the diet plans, body image discussions, check in sessions it is truly worth every single rupee. She is holistic in her approach, incorporating science each step of the way and focusing not just on food but also water intake, sleep and stress. Bhavana is able to distill complicated scientific information in a very simple explanation that helps guide behavior changes. Thanks!
